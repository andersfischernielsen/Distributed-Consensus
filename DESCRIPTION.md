# Algorithm Description

The algorithm is implemented using the following F# data types:

	///A unique identifier type of the local timestamp and ID of a given node.
    type Age = {
        LocalTimestamp: int;
        Id: string
    }
    
    ///A state of a node.
    type State = {
        Pending: bool;
        Excluded: bool
    }
    
    ///The beginning and end of an execution of a Node. The bool signifies whether the execution was succesful. The Age is an identifier for when the Execution started and when it ended.
    type Execution = 
        | Begin of Age
        | Finish of bool * Age
    
    ///A type for the different kinds of edges between nodes in the graph.
    type Relation = {
        | Includes
        | IncludedBy
        | Excludes
        | ExcludedBy
        | SetsPending
        |Â SetPendingBy
        | CheckedConditon of bool
        | ChecksConditon of bool
    }
    
    ///The "log entry" in the built history. Every node stores one StateChange for every event that occurs related involving a Relation. The final history is then built from all StateChanges of all nodes.
    type StateChange = {
        Author: Age;
        Relation: Relation;
        Counterpart: string option
    }

The algorithm works by collecting every StateChange from all nodes in the system and determining what the history of execution was in the system. 

Using the `LocalTimestamp` and `Id` of `Age`s we can build a _happens-before_ relation of the system up to the current point in time and determine what/if any nodes are faulty. 

The algorithm fetches the initial and current `State` of every node to further assist in creating the history.



## Relation Scenarios
\#{number} is the local timestamp, note that because it is local, the *included* can have a lower timestamp than the *includer*.

### Inclusion
| Inclusion Relation       | Event 1: history                   | Event 2: history                   |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|

| Event 1 Execution fails  | (#1, Event 1, false) |
| Event 1 Execution succes | (#1, Event 1, true)  |


## Distribution algorithm

Algorithm:
 - Get asked by X for history
 - If CreatingHistory is false 
    - Set CreatingHistory to true
    - Ask all neighbors for history.
        - If neighbors return nothing
            - Create own history
            - Return history to Caller X
        - If neighbors return something
            - Create own history
            - Stich together
            - Return to Caller X
    - Set CreatingHistory to false
 - If CreatingHistory is True
    - Return none

Consider the following graph:

<img src='http://g.gravizo.com/g?
 digraph G {
   | "Event 5" -> "Event 3"
   | "Event 5" -> "Event 2"
   | "Event 3" -> "Event 5"
   | "Event 3" -> "Event 1"
   | "Event 2" -> "Event 1"
   | "Event 2" -> "Event 3"
   | "Event 1" -> "Event 4"
   | "Event 1" -> "Event 6"
   | "Event 6" -> "Event 1"
 }
'/>

- Event 5 gets asked by *Client* for its history. 
    - It sets its CreatingHistory boolean to true. 
    - Asks all its neighbors (Event 2 and Event 5) for their history.
- Event 2 gets asked by Event 5 of their history
    - It sets its CreatingHistory boolean to true. 
    - Asks all its neighbors (Event 3 and Event 1) for their history.
- Event 3 gets asked by Event 5 of their history
    - It sets its CreatingHistory boolean to true. 
    - Asks all its neighbors (Event 5 and Event 1) for their history.
- Event 3 gets asked by Event 2 of their history
    - return is already creating history
- Event 1 gets asked by Event 2 of their history
    - It sets its CreatingHistory boolean to true. 
    - Asks all its neighbors (Event 4) for their history.
- Event 4 gets asked by Event 1 of their history
    - It sets its CreatingHistory boolean to true. 
    - Asks all its neighbors (None) for their history. (has none)
    - Since No neighbors return a history to Caller (Event 1)
- Event 1 gets asked by Event 3 of their history
    - return is already creating history
- Event 6 gets asked by Event 1 of their history
    - It sets its CreatingHistory boolean to true. 
    - Asks all its neighbors (Event 1) for their history.
    - Since No neighbors return a history (6 is already working) to Caller (Event 1)
- Event 1 gets asked by Event 6 of their history
    - return is already creating history
- Event 1 gets history from Event 4 and Event 6
    - Get own history
    - Stitch together history of neighbors and self
    - return history to Caller (Event 2)
- Event 2 gets history from 6 and empty from 3
    - Get own history
    - Stitch together history of neighbors and self
    - return history to Caller (Event 5)
- Event 3 gets no history from neighbors
    - Get own history
    - return history to Caller (Event 5)
