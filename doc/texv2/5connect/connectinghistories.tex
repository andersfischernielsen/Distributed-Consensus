	\section{Creating Distributed  History} % Giv bedre navn
	In order to build a history for the events reachable in the system, local histories for connected events have to be connected somehow in order to enable finding a global history. 
	
	Using the concept of happens-before relations helps determining what events (or executions of events) have happened before others. 
	
	The individual actions that have happened on an event will have happens-before relations between them, according to the rule that if $A$ and $B$ occur on the same process, then $A \rightarrow B$ if $A$ happened before $B$ on event $E$. 
	Futhermore edges can be created between actions on two different events, if $A$ is registered as sent on event $a$ and is registered as received on event $b$.
	
	The concepts of transitivity, irreflexivity and antisymmetry also apply to the happens-before relation. That is if $A \rightarrow B$ and $B \rightarrow C$, then $A \rightarrow C$ (transitivity), $A \not\rightarrow A$ (irreflexivity) and if $A \not\equiv B$ and $A \rightarrow B$ then $B \not\rightarrow A$ (antisymmetry).
	
	Using the representation of history detailed in \ref{chap:representing-a-history} it is possible to create a graph of happens-before relations.

	It is necessary to filter actions depending on their type. If a history describing an order of execution is desired, then every action except for \texttt{ExecutionStart} and \texttt{ExecutionEnd} must be removed from the history graph.

	\section{Connecting Histories using Algorithms} % Giv bedre navn
	The implementation of determining happens-before relations works by looking at every node in the history graph, creating an edge between nodes of the given type wishing to be found, and adding the node the edge is going to to the list of nodes to check. The algorithm is implemented in such a way that the iteration through the history graph is a Breath First Search.
