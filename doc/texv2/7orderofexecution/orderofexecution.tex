\chapter{Reducing Histories to Order of Execution}
\label{chap:order-of-execution}
\section{Collapsing}
\subsection{korrekthed}
The found order of execution still represents the same history and have the same properties as to the order. Given the definition of serially equivalence, which executions complies with, requires that two processes happen after one another. Therefore the set of actions which are after actions in an execution must happen after that execution finishes, just as well as all action which happen before actions in an execution must happen before the execution starts.
