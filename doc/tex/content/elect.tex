\subsection{Goal} % Hvad er problemet
The goal of the algorithm is, given a partially ordered history, to reach consensus upon the history between the participating events of the history.

\subsection{Implementation}
Since the partially ordered history includes URIs to all the events of the system, the initiator of the history call can contact all events who have contributed to the history. By sending the history to all the contributing events, each of them can send back an Accept or Reject call, thereby having an election on the created history. Then according to the regular rules of distributed system elections, if the majority accepts the proposed value, and no more than a third of the events are byzantine\todo{Source?}, the election can be accepted, and returned.

\subsection{Performance}
Requires \texttt{2N} calls where \texttt{N} is the number of events in the system.
