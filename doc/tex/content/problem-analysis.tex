\chapter{Algorithms}
The overall problem is: given a DCR graph with possible malicious nodes, for the events of the graph to reach consensus of a partial order of execution that has happened in that graph.

The algorithm consists of the following subalgorithms executed in that order:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Produce - which gathers the history.
    \item Elect - which checks if the majority of the workflow can accept the proposed history
    \item Simplify - which takes the history and creates an execution only history.
\end{itemize}

Correcness should be based on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How many events can be corrupted.
    \item How well the algorithm can determine which events are corrupted.
    \item how well the algorithm can determine if any and how many events are corrupted.
\end{itemize}

%History is created by using Fetch-and-Stitch with validation in the stitching phase.

%The receiver of the first create history call should

%- create history ID
%- fetch history from neighbours
%    - each of these should:
%        - fetch
%        - stitch
%        - return
%- stitch
%- Call for a vote
%- Clousure of event graph to an execution graph.
