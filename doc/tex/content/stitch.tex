\section{Stitch}
\subsection{Analysis} % Hvad er problemet
The goal of the algortithm is to: given a list of graphs representing partial order of logs and a local graph representing the partial order of logs - stitch the graphs of logs into the local graph such that the graph still fulfills that it represents the partial order of the union of logs from input graphs.\\

Correctness should be based on:
\begin{enumarate}
    \item That it creates a partial ordered graph
    \item How well it handles faulty logs
    \item How well it handles faulty graphs
\end{enumarate}

Logs should not be understood as executions only but all the different kinds of logs, see log description.
A partially ordered graph should not contain cycles.
