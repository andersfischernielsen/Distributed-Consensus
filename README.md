# Bachelor Thesis - Consensus of History in Distributed DCR Graphs
The repository for our bachelor project concerning creating a valid history of events in a distributed system.

## Project Definition
_Given an execution of a distributed DCR graph, the purpose of this project is to find an algorithm which uses the local orders of execution of the individual events to find a global order of execution with the least amount of concurrency, where the local orders are preserved in the global order. Furthermore, the algorithm should be able to observe and if possible, identify which events in the workflow are part of malicious behaviour, where malicious behaviour is the act of disobeying the rules of the workflow or reporting false information. Finally the algorithm should establish distributed consensus on the order of execution among the events._
